# TODO: Fix Production Connection Issue

## Problem
- In production on Render, creating a property causes "connection was closed unexpectedly" error.
- Locally works fine.

## Root Cause
- Likely due to Redis cache backend not being available on Render, causing cache operations to fail and close the connection.

## Changes Made
- [x] Changed CACHES to use LocMemCache instead of Redis.
- [x] Added logging to CreatePropertyView for debugging.
- [x] Added logging configuration to settings.py.

## Next Steps
- Deploy the changes to Render.
- Test the property creation endpoint.
- Check Render logs for any errors or the added logs.
- If still failing, check for DB connection issues or timeouts.
